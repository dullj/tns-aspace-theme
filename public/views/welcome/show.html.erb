    <p>Collection Guides (also called <a href="https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/finding-aid.html">finding aids</a>) describe archival collections held by The New School Archives. When a new collection becomes available for research, the guide for the collection is added to this site.</p>
  
    <h3>What are archival collections?</h3>
    <p>Archival collections are groups of primary source materials created by a person, group of people, or organization in the course of their everyday work or activities. Collections can range in size from a single document to hundreds of boxes or gigabytes of digital files. They can contain a range of materials, including documents, drawings, photographs, websites, and audiovisual records. Unlike published materials, archival collections are usually unique and exist only in the collection where a researcher finds them.</p>

    <h3>What is not on this site?</h3>
    <p>Collection guides inform researchers about a collection; they do not contain the actual documents in a collection. To learn more about using collection guides, see this <a href="https://guides.library.newschool.edu/c.php?g=274422&p=1830828" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGuide.</a></p>

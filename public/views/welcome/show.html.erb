    <h3>Welcome to The New School Archives Collection Guides</h3>
    <p>On this site you can search collection guides (also called finding aids) that describe archival collections held by The New School Archives. When a new collection becomes available for research, the guide for the collection is added to this site.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What are archival collections?</h3>
    <p>Archival collections are groups of primary source materials created by a person, group of people, or organization in the course of their everyday work or activities. Collections can range in size from a single document to hundreds of boxes or gigabytes of digital files. They can contain a range of materials, including documents, drawings, photographs, websites, and audiovisual records. The materials in archival collections are usually unique and exist only in the collection where a researcher finds them.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3>What is not on this site?</h3>
    <p>Collection guides inform researchers about a collection; they do not contain the actual documents in a collection. To learn more about using them, see this <a href="https://guides.library.newschool.edu/c.php?g=274422&p=1830828">LibGuide.</a></p>

    <h4>Digital Collections</h4> 
    <p>While the guides you find here contain links to collections that include digitized or born-digital material, not everything in the Archives is available in digital form. To browse and search the digital archives, visit our <a href="https://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/">Digital Collections</a> database.</p>

    <h4>Unprocessed Collections</h4>
    <p>This site does not include collections in The New School Archives that have not yet been cataloged. If you cannot find the information you are seeking here, contact us at archives@newschool.edu and we will gladly check our internal database for you.</p>

    <h4>Items in the Library</h4>
    <p>Use The New School Library catalog to search for published library materials, such as books, journals, and commercial recordings.</p>

    <h4>Special Collections</h4> 
    <p>Information about our published Special Collections holdings, such as artists' books and scores, can be found <a href="http://kellenarchives.com/">here.</a></p>
